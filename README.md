# Ai
This is a collection of all of my AI work as I learn AI in general 

Here are some models that I have trained 
- [Addition](https://github.com/Joshua-Ge/Ai/blob/main/AdditionAi/Addition_Ai_(100%25).ipynb) This is an AI model that I trained using randomly selected addition problems with their solutions for numbers below 999. This AI was one of my first to develop and uses linear regression to fine-tune the neural network
- [Square Root](https://github.com/Joshua-Ge/Ai/blob/main/SquareRootGuessing/SquarerootGuessing(99.99%25).ipynb) This is an AI model that I trained on the square roots of 100000 numbers. I used a few methods, one of which I implemented was a random forest regressor, as it worked better than linear regression and fit the logarithmic scale more effectively.
