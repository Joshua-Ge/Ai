# Ai
This is a collection of all of my AI work as I learn AI in general 

Here are some models that I have trained 
- [Addition](https://github.com/Joshua-Ge/Ai/blob/main/AdditionAi/Addition_Ai_(100%25).ipynb) This is an AI model that I trained using randomly selected addition problems with their solutions for numbers below 999. This AI was one of my first to develop and uses linear regression to fine-tune the neural network
- [Square Root](https://github.com/Joshua-Ge/Ai/blob/main/SquareRootGuessing/SquarerootGuessing(99.99%25).ipynb) This is an AI model that I trained on the square roots of 100000 numbers. I used a few methods, one of which I implemented was a random forest regressor, as it worked better than linear regression and fit the logarithmic scale more effectively. Then I asked ChatGPT what would be the best way to do this, and it told me to use a pipeline to fit the relationship of the variables as closely as possible to the logarithmic relationship that the target and features share. This, however, yielded worse results than the random forest regressor.
