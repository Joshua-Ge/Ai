# Ai
This is a collection of all of my AI work as I learn AI in general 

Here are some models that I have trained 
- [Addition](https://github.com/Joshua-Ge/Ai/blob/main/AdditionAi/Addition_Ai_(100%25).ipynb) This is an AI model that I trained using randomly selected addition problems with their solutions for numbers below 999. This AI was one of my first to develop and uses linear regression to fine-tune the neural network
- [Square Root](https://github.com/Joshua-Ge/Ai/blob/main/Square_rootInvestigation/Ai_guessing_square_roots.ipynb) This is an investigation where I looked into the effect of the data set's size on performance. If you'd like to read more, you can see the text file inside.
